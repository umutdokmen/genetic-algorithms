Solving TSP using genetic algorithms:
I implemented a basic Genetic Algorithm to optimize the path for the Travelling Salesman Problem. I represented cities with numbers. Each possible solution in my population contained exactly given 11 cities with different order. I used Python without any library or framework in this project.
